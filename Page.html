		<h2> Introduction: Our group picked a same mouse with different DPI and their effectiveness. (Conclusion at the End)</h2>
      Blue: 400 DPI; Orange: 800 DPI; Green: 2000 DPI
      <br>As shown in the graph fig. 2 is the distribution and median of different DPIs.
      <br>In the graph fig. 3 is the detailed distribution of each DPI settings and their effectiveness.
      <br>We kept the width and distance of the red dots the same and tested the motion with different DPIs.

      Conclusion
    </h2>
    We can see that the results from both fig 2 are a bit different and in general the ID for low DPI is higher than the other 2.
    <br>However, extremely high DPI may not be a good idea. From the fig 2s, the green(2000 DPI) do not perform a lower ID than orange (800 DPI).
    <br>For time consuming, higher DPI has pattern of taking a lot of time from Mingrui's test result. This might be it is too sensitive and went over the borders.
    <br>The highest DPI is more time consumed than the other two is because its high sensitivity and easy to go off from the intended destination.
    <br>However, for personal habits, it seems Mingrui is used to lower DPI settings (400 DPI), where Vincent is used to a bit higher settings (800 PI) according to their performence.
    <br>From fig 3s, that showed the detailed distribution of each click.
    <br>The 3 DPIs all gave (roughly) same results at ID 3.5-4 because they are the general pattern and the rest are based on the person's daily habits, so they varies.
